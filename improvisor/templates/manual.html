  <section id="assets">
    <h1>Assets</h1>
    <p>Assets are any png, jpeg, text files and links, that you want to use in your presentation. Added assets
      are stored on the server and are ready to be used in any presentation. You can access the assets page by clicking
      on the 'Asset Pool' button on the right-hand side of the main page. </p>
    <img class="manualImg" src="{{url_for('static', filename='resources/manual/assetPool.png')}}" alt="Asset page">


        <h3 id="addNew">Adding New Assets</h3>
        <p>
          To add a new asset go to the 'Asset Pool' page and click the 'Add' button that is situated in the right
          top corner. On the next page enter the asset name and asset tags that will be associated with it. Next, you can choose if you want the asset to be a file (pdf, jpeg, png) or a link. As a default, it is set to file. Then choose a file, or enter http(s) address of the link. Once the file has been selected, or link entered, a default thumbnail will be displayed. If you want the name of the asset to be used as a thumbnail tick the 'Use name as thumbnail' checkbox. Alternatively, you can click on the displayed image and select a different file that will be used as a thumbnail.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you would like to add multiple assets at once, you can click on the '+ Add Asset' button which will display an additional form for the next asset. Once you have completed all fields for all assets, you can save them by clicking on the 'Submit' button.
        </p>

        <p>
          To make sure that the selected tags will be recognised by speech recognition, you can test them by clicking on the
          'Test Recognition' button in the bottom right corner of the screen. Then say a sentence containing your tag and
          see if the output contains the tag that you want to use.

        <h3 id="edit">Editing Assets</h3>
        <p>
          Added assets can be deleted, or edited. To access this feature, go to 'Asset Pool' where all saved assets will be displayed. The assets can be sorted by when they were added ('Most Recent' or 'Oldest First'), or by relevance. To sort by relevance tags need to be provided in the 'Filter Tags:' input box. When more than one tag is provided, only assets that are linked to all tags will be displayed.
        </p>
        <img class="manualImg" src="{{url_for('static', filename='resources/manual/editAssetMain.png')}}" alt="Asset page">
        <p>
          To delete an assets you can click on it, which will display its details, and then click on 'Delete Asset'. Alternatively, click on the 'Select' button, that is situated above the box that displays all assets, and then select an asset to delete. A 'Delete' button will appear next to the 'Select' button. Clicking on the 'Delete' button will delete the selected asset. By using the 'Select' button you can highlight multiple assets and delete all of them at the same time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Clicking on a particular asset will open a page with the asset details, where changes can be applied. Here you can modify the thumbnail, by clicking on it and selecting a new thumbnail file, or ticking the 'Use name as thumbnail' checkbox. Additionally, the name can be updated (by clicking on it) and tags can be added or deleted. When adding new tags, you can test if they will be recognised properly, using the 'Test Recognition' in the bottom right corner of the screen.

  <section id="sessions">
    <h1>Sessions</h1>

        <h3 id="activeSession">Active Session</h3>
        <p>
          A session represents one presentation. Once a session has been started it can be paused and then restarted at any time. The session will remain active until a new session is started. When a new profile is created, only a new session can be started by clicking on the 'New Session' button in the main menu. If there are already previous sessions, an option to 'Continue Session' will become available. A particular session will remain active until a new one is started.
        </p>

        <h3 id="sessionMode">Session Modes</h3>
        <p>
          When a new session is started, or an option to continue the previous session is selected, you will be given two mode choices: 'Presenter' and 'Controler'.
        </p>
        <p>
          The 'Presenter' mode is the area where assets (slides) will be displayed. This mode should be open on the main display, that is dedicated to the audience.
        </p>
        <p>
          The 'Controler' mode should be open on a mobile device, that will be used to control what is displayed for the audience. This is the main view that will be used during a presentation. When the mode is entered the speech recognition is, by default, switched off. To switch this feature on click the microphone icon in the top right corner. Clicking the icon again will switch the recognition off.
        </p>
        <p>
          The main part of the screen in the 'Controler' mode is divided into 3 parts. The first part is the 'Current' list. All recognised tags will be displayed there, ordered by the number of times each tag has been mentioned. The assets whose tags were mentioned the most will be located on the left side of the list. To select an asset from the list click on a thumbnail, which will bring it to the foreground and will make it bigger, then swipe the thumbnail up to display it on the presenter. Selecting an asset from the 'Current' list will clear the list (the list will not be cleared until the next tag is recognised).
        </p>
        <img class="manualImg" src="{{url_for('static', filename='resources/manual/controlerMode.png')}}" alt="Asset page">
        <p>
          The second part of the 'Controler' view is dedicated to a 'Frequent' list. As with the previous list, all assets linked to the mentioned tags will be added here and ordered by the number of mentions. The assets can be selected from the list in the same way as from the 'Current' list. The main difference with this list is that selecting an asset will not clear it and new items will continue to be added.
        </p>
        <p>
          The last part of this mode view is a tab section. By default, there is only one tab and you can add another 4 tabs by clicking on the plus button. The currently selected tab can be recognised by a white background button with blue text. The inactive tabs have the colours reversed. Each displayed asset will appear in the active tab so it can be easily seen which assets have already been shown. They can also be used to re-displayed a previously shown asset, or simply to break up the used assets into separate tabs. The assets are selected from the tabs in the same way as from the two previous lists.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a case where the speech recognition is unable to recognize a tag, you can look for it manually. To do this click on the magnifying glass icon in the middle of the navigation bar. Pressing the button will open a modal with an input box and a button. First, enter the tag and then press the 'Go' button. Assets associated with the tag will be displayed in a list. Click a thumbnail of an asset you want to show to the audience and once it is highlighted swipe it up.
        </p>

        <h3 id="prevSessions">Previous Sessions</h3>
        <p>
          All previous sessions are saved and can be accessed from the main menu by clicking on 'Previous Sessions'. You will be presented with a list of all sessions which can be sorted by their date. The last session on the list (the most recent one) will always be active, and the status will change to finished only when a new one is started.
        </p>
        <img class="manualImg" src="{{url_for('static', filename='resources/manual/sessions.png')}}" alt="Asset page">
        <p>
          Clicking on any of the sessions from the list displays the session's details. Here you can amend the session's name (by clicking on it), export assets shown during the session in a pdf file, or delete the session.
        </p>
