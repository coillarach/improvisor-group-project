Next you can choose if you want the asset to be a file (pdf, jpeg, png) or a link (4). As default, it is set to file. Then choose a file, or enter http(s) address of the link. Once the file has been selected, or link entered, a default thumbnail will be displayed. If you want the name of the asset to be used as a thumbnail tick the 'Use nama as thumbnail' checkbox (5). Alternatively, you can click on the displayed image and select a different file that will be used as a thumbnail.

The assets can be sorted by when they were added ('Most Recent' or 'Oldest First'), or by relevance. To sort by relevance tags need to be provided in the 'Filter Tags:' input box. When more than one tag is provided, only assets that are linked to all tags will be displayed.

    <h1>Sessions</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3 id="activeSession">Active Session</h3>
        <p>
          A session represents one presentation. Once a session has been started it can be paused and then restarted at any time. The session will remain active until a new session is started. When a new profile is created, only a new session can be started by clicking on 'New Session' button in the main menu. If there are already previous sessions, an option to 'Continue Session' will become available. A particular session will remain active untill a new one is started.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3 id="sessionMode">Session Modes</h3>
        <p>
          When a new session is started, or an option to continue the previous session is selected, you will be given two mode choices: 'Presenter' and 'Controler'.
        </p>
        <p>
          The 'Presenter' mode is the area where assets (slides) will be displayed. This mode should be open on the main display, that is dedicated for the audience.
        </p>
        <p>
          The 'Controler' mode should be open on a mobile device, that will be used to control what is displayed for the audience. This is the main view that will be used during a presentation. When the mode is entered the speech recognition is by default switched off. To switch this feature on click on the microphone icon in the top right corner. Clicking the icon again will switch the recognition off.

        </p>
          In a case where the speech recognition is unable to recognize a tag, you can look for it manually. To do this click on the magnifying glass icon in the middle of the navigation bar. Pressing the button will open a modal with an input box and a button. First, enter the tag and then press the 'Go' button. Assets associated with the tag will be displayed in a list. Click a thumbnail of an asset you want to show to the audience and once it is highlited swipe it up.
